    #Tic Tac Toe Planning and Pseudo Coding

    ## TTT Prep Todos

    * [ ] 3 hours looking back and review (if you feel like there is an area to review)
    * [ ] Wireframe what TTT will look like on webpage
        * What HTML elements do you need?   
        * What will the user click on?
        * Think about the 'user experience' -- what HTML elements are needed for that
    * [ ] Create project files and check if they are linked
    * [ ] Copy this pseudo into your files and write more pseudo code if needed
    ## Planning Code
    <!-- HTML: what elements are needed for your user experience-->
