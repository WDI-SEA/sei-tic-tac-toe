<!-- PREP -->
<!-- make a simple wireframe of TTT website: -->
    <!-- all of the html elements that will be needed for the game -->
    <!-- visually draw boxes out of the page layout -->
    <!-- simple mock up -->
<!-- review phase: -->
    <!-- use the gitbook -->
    <!-- code you wrote in lecture or deliverables or labs -->
    <!-- do google around concepts -->

<!-- ## html -->
    <!-- your index.html -->
    <!-- grid of nine squares (3 divs with 3 divs in each)-->
        <!-- display: inline (or inline block) -->
        <!-- divs should be numbered and this will correlate to the indices of the array. give each div a unique id (0, 1, 2)-->
    <!-- area to display user messages (whose turn it is, if someone won)-->
    <!-- reset button -->

<!-- CSS -->
<!-- styles.css -->
<!-- just enough styling to setup the gameboard (function before form) -->

<!-- Javascript -->
<!-- we need to keep track of the gameboard in javascript -->
    <!-- a way to index squares that correlates to the array-->
    <!-- way to make the x's and o's stick -->
    <!-- we need to use an array to keep track of x's and o's -->
    <!-- option 1: 1d array: ['','','','','','','','',''] and each one correlates to a div -->
    <!-- option 2: trickier but 2d array: -->
        <!-- parent array [ -->
                <!-- ['x','',''] -->
                <!-- ['','','o'] -->
                <!-- ['','','o'] -->
            <!-- ] -->
            <!-- array[0][0] -->

<!-- a variable that tracks whose turn it currently is - this would start off as 'x' -->
<!-- a variable that tracks if the game is running or not -->
    <!-- let isRunning = true -->
<!-- event listeners - clicking on the divs and making x's or o's appear  -->
    <!-- when a square is clicked, do the following -->
        <!-- FIRST check if that spot in the array is empty and isRunning is true, if so, do the following -->
            <!-- we make an x or o appear - could be as simple as setting the inner text to an x-->
            <!-- check if a win has occured -->
                <!-- check all 8 win cases for x and for o -->
                <!-- cats games could check if all spaces are filled (verbose) -->
                <!-- variable that increments after 9 moves and no wins = cats game-->
                <!-- if the game is won or a cats game occurs - set isRunning to be false -->
                    <!-- have a variable that increments every turn and at 9 if there are no wins then calls a cats game -->
                        <!-- if game is won - we could remove the gameboard-->
                        <!--or you could fill up the array-->
                        <!--delete a class to prevent listeners -->
            <!-- alternate players if a win did not occur by changing the variable 'x' or 'o' that tracks whose turn it currently is-->
            <!-- increment the turn counter to move closer to the cats condition -->
<!--  a way to block off squares that have been selected-->
