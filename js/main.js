// Decide State Variables for Game:
// 1. Keep track of who's turn it is (turn: playerOne (1)/playerTwo (-1))
// 2. Track board state (board: 2D array)
//       null -> no player
//       playerOne/playerTwo -> player at that cell   
// 3. Variable for winner (winner: yes or no)
//      null -> no winner / in play
//      playerOne/playerTwo -> winner
//      'T' -> tie
