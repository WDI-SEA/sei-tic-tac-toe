1. 3-4 hours looking back reviewing (identify areas you need to cover and look over them)

2. wireframe of what TT will look like on the page (on piece of paper)
    -what HTML elements will you need?
    -what will the user click on?
    -think about the user experience -> what HTML elements are needed for that?
3. create your project files and folders and check that they are linked up
4. copy the following pseudo code into your project files:
    //PLANNING PSEUDO code

    htmlembedded
    //html file
    //what html elements are needed for the user experience?

    css
    //css file
    //what CSS do you need to make your html look like your wireframes
    //DO NO WRITE ANY OTHER CSS/DO ANY OTHER STYLING UNTIL THE JS IS COMPLETE

    javascript
    //APP STATE (variables)
        //the gameboard -- use an array
        [    
            [ 'x', ' ', ' ' ]
            [ 'x', 'o', ' ' ]
            [ 'x', 'o', ' ' ]
        ]    
    //var for whose turn it is
    //(maybe) -- has the game been won? boolean
    //DOM content loaded
    //query selector(s) to handle user clicks
        //current plater needs to be marked on the board -- if that space is empty (conditional) using css (if you want  to use it)
        //that move needs to be placed in the gameboard array
        //function that checks if there is a winner from the gameboard array
    //function that checks if there is a winner
        //in that function -- if else statements
            //checking all of the win conditions
                //if a win is found -- stop the game and show the winner
                //otherwise let game continue
        //and cats games (after nine moves) (or gameboard is full and no winner)
