Preparation
make a simple mockup/wireframe of your TTT board
think of all the html elements you will need to structure the document (TTT board, message area, page title)
visually draw out everything out
review phase
look over lessons this week that you need to review
read the gitbook
review the code lessons/labs
do some googling
start writing code and do not panic
copy our psuedocode into your files
Psuedocode
html
<!-- your index.html -->
<!-- header for page -->
<!-- grid of nine squares -->
<!-- some kind of area for a message to the player -->
<!-- button rest -->
css
/* styles.css */
/* just enough styling to get a gird and setup the gameboard */
/* DO NOT DO ANY OTHER STYLING UNTIL YOU ARE FINISHED */
javascript
// script.js

// APP STATE (varaibles)
    // players choices (a vritual representation of the gameboard)
        // use an array (1d array approach) ['x', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'o', '']
        // 2d array approach
        // [
        //     ['x', '', ''],
        //     ['', '', ''],
        //     ['', 'o', '']
        // ]
    // whose turn it is (is it x or o)
    // a boolean value that tells you if the game is currently running
    // (optional) a turn counter that is used to detect cats games when it reaches 9
    // (bonus) -- how many times each player has won

// EVENT LISTENERS
    // a click on the reset button
    // event listener for when you click on the gameboard
        // when a square is clicked we should do the following:
        // set the innertext of the square that got clicked on of whose turn it currently it
        // prevent repeat clicks -- check the gameboard array or check the innertext
        // set the move into the gameboard array 
        // check if there is a winner
            // if someone has won, end the game and updated the message for who has won
                // think about all the conditions to win the game and check for all of them
            // check for cats game
                // if every square is an x or an o and no one has won   
                // or count turns    
            // if no one has won, let gameplay continue (switch turns)
