// EVENT LISTENERS
    // click event listener(s) for player clicks
        // change innertext of div to X or O
        // store the player's move in the gameBoard array
        // change to the next player's turn
        // check for a win -- calling a win condition function/doing all the win logic
    // click event to clear/reset the board

// some way to tell if a player has already clicked on a square
// win/tie game logic in functions
    // option: detect a win using conditionals and comparisions 
    // option hard mode: store all winning conditions and use loops to compare them to the gameBoard array
        // if the game is won, display the winner and prevent the users from clicking more
        // if it is a cats game, display that and prevent clicks
