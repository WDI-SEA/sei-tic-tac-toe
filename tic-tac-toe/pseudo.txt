** HTML ***
1. Header
    -Game Title
2. Container Div
3. Inside container, make 9 divs give each an id to correspond array index(indexes always start with 0), and give all of them the same class. (check if you can use a number as an id.)
4. Make Results Div

** CSS (NOT A PRIORITY**
1. Make click space Div display 3 x 3 ( google display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap)
2. Borders
3. Make X and O But put display none unless clicked??? (HOW TO CHECK WHICH ONE TO DISPLAY?? TF?????????) (I didn't do this. Too complex for me.)

** JAVASCRIPT **

1. Get all necessary html elements and store them in variables.
2. Make the click spaces into an array. (Use Array.from)
    this makes all the divs with the same class into an array.
3. Make a separate Array to track which spaces have been clicked. (arrays can have empty strings, or null values * number of click spaces)

4. loop through the clickspaces array to give them an eventListener individually.
4. Toggle the currentPlayer between player1/X and player2/O (BOOLEAN????) 


5. Get all possible winning combinations. 
6. Check if currentPlayer matches one winningCombo
7. If there's a winner, deny access to game. (Make another div, display none, and if there's a winner, this div will cover game board???)
8. Restart/ New Game Button (Put this in the div/container that covers the game board????)



** QUESTIONS FOR TA **

1. This is if I use png images instead of x and o. I made a container div, and inside of it there are 9 sub container divs. each subcontainer divs has an img tag. 
    Then I made an array of the subcontainers. How do I access the img src inside each of the subcontainers?
    I want it so that when I click a sub container, the src of the img inside the subcontainer I clicked will be set to the url I stored in the currentPlayer variable.


2. Can you put another switch-case inside another switch-case? The same was as you can put nest another if/else statement inside another if/else statement?

3. const arr = ["","","","","",""]

    if(arr[0]){
        console.log("something is in the array")
    } else {
        console.log("there's" nothing in the array)
    }

GET WINNER FUNCTION 1:

1. Store all winningNumbersCombo in an winningCombosArray. (an array of arrays containing winning number combos)
2. 
3. 


CURRENT BUGS:

1. If there's no way to get a winner, it spits out an alert saying "Winner at ${number combos}
    => make a movesCounter, every time a space is clicked, movesCounter--
    => declare winner = true; 
    => if(movesCounter === 0 &&& winner = false){
        gameOver()
    }
